### 3.3 Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to ProjectName? You can start by looking through `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/zpm-shell/zpm/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/zpm-shell/zpm/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.
